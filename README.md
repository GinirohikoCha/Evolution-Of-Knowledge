# Evolution Of Knowledge 1.12

This is the development repository of The Evolution Of Knowledge on Minecraft 1.12.2.

# Introduction
The Evolution Of Knowledge is a Minecraft mod trying to redefine the general idea of existing technology mods. 
Rather than simply adding a huge number of components and recipes to recurrent the work flow of modern industrial 
productions, EOK try to recurrent the human civilization from a developmental perspective. By introducing the concept

of developments of science and technology in human history.
